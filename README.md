Design a Y-shape Building with Normal strength concrete (M25). First, we did the survey geotech and soil testing and soil data analysis after that, we calculated the load (Dead load, Live load, Wind load, Seismic load) and then made the SAP model for buildings. Design the beams, columns, Slab, Stairs, Shear wall, and Foundation design.
